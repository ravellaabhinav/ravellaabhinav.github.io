Here's a brief intro – since Abhinav is not quite as famous as Robert Downey Jr. to say, "You know who I am."
{{< /lead >}}

**Abhinav Ravella** is a curious software engineer who's always in awe of the wonders that 0<sub>s</sub> and 1<sub>s</sub> could create. His current role is in the banking domain, where he develops Java and Spring Boot microservices powering payment execution, account-state processing, and regulatory workflows at scale.

Previously, Abhinav worked in the healthcare domain at Philips, engineering backend and full-stack systems used across 50+ hospitals for patient administration, device coordination, and clinical workflows. His experience spans event-driven architectures with Apache Kafka, cloud-native deployments on AWS, database performance tuning, and production observability for mission-critical systems.

Abhinav holds a Master’s degree in Computer Science and brings a strong foundation in distributed systems, backend APIs, and full-stack development. While backend engineering is his core focus, he also builds React and TypeScript interfaces that surface complex backend workflows into usable, real-time experiences for internal users.

He enjoys understanding how large systems behave in production, improving reliability, and automating repeatable engineering tasks. Outside work, Abhinav spends time reading technical deep-dives, experimenting with system design ideas, or refining personal projects.
